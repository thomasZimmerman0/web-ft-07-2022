# Homework - Anonymous Functions & Callbacks

## 1. Positive Numbers

Write a function which takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the positive numbers in the given array.

## 2. Even Numbers

Write a function which takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the even numbers in the given array.


## 3. Square the Numbers

Write a function which takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing result of squaring each of the numbers in the given array by two. Example: `squareTheNumbers([1, 2, 3])` should give `[1, 4, 9]`.


## 4. Cities 1

Write a function which takes an array of city objects like such:

```
var cities = [
{ name: 'Los Angeles', temperature: 60.0},
{ name: 'Atlanta', temperature: 52.0 },
{ name: 'Detroit', temperature: 48.0 },
{ name: 'New York', temperature: 80.0 } ];
```

as input and returns a new array containing the cities whose temperature is cooler than 70 degrees.


## 5. Cities 2

Write a function which takes an array of city objects like the above problem as input and returns an array of the cities names.

## 6. Good Job!

```
var people = [ 'Dom', 'Lyn', 'Kirk', 'Autumn', 'Trista', 'Jesslyn', 'Kevin', 'John', 'Eli', 'Juan', 'Robert', 'Keyur', 'Jason', 'Che', 'Ben' ];
```

Print out `'Good Job, {{name}}!'` for each person's name, one on a line.

## 7. Sort an array

Given an array of strings such the array of names given in the previous problem, sort them by alphabetically order.

## 8. Sort an array, 2

Sort the same array, but not by alphabetically order, but by how long each name is, shortest name first.

## 9. Sort an array, 3

Given an array of array of numbers like:

```
var arr = [
[1, 3, 4],
[2, 4, 6, 8],
[3, 6] ];
```

Sort the array by the sum of each inner array. For the above example, the respective sums for each inner array is 8, 20, and 9. Therefore, the solution should be:

```
[ [1, 3, 4],
[3, 6],
[2, 4, 6, 8] ]
```

## 10. 3 times

Given this function:

```
function call3Times(fun) { fun(); fun(); fun(); }
```

Use the `call3Times` function to print "Hello, world!" 3 times.


## 11. n times

You will write a function callNTimes that takes two arguments: times as a number, and fun as a function. It will call that function for that many times. Example:

```
> callNTimes(5, hello)
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
```
You are allowed to use a loop in the implementation of callNTimes.

## 12. Sum an array

Write a function sum that takes an array of numbers as argument and returns the sum of those numbers. Use the reduce method to do this.

```
> sum([1, 2, 3])
6
```

## 13. Acronym


Write a function acronym that takes an array of words as argument and returns the acronym of the words. Use the reduce method to do this.

```
> acronym(['very', 'important', 'person'])
