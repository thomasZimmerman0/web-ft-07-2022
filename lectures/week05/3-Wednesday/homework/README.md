# Homework - APIs

## 1. Weather App


In this exercise we'll create a weather app that allows a user to look up the weather for their city using the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/current).


**Register for An API Key**
http://openweathermap.org/appid

**Make it Pretty**
Use some CSS and/or graphics to spruce up the joint.

Examples:

- use graphics or icons for each different state of weather
- apply a consistent layout to each page
- etc



## 2. Game of Thrones


For more practice with using Ajax to get remote data, try accessing the information from this Game of Thrones info API:

https://anapioficeandfire.com/

 

Some ideas:

- grab a list of all of the characters, and print out their name and what house they belong to
- make the name of the house clickable; when you click on it, print the house information either to the console or to the page
