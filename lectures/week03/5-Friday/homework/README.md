# Create a Restaurant Page in Bootstrap

Redo the Huynh restaurant site (2-3) pages using bootstrap.
The original site is here: http://huynhrestauranthouston.com/cgi-bin/p/awtp-home.cgi?d=huynh-restaurant

Or, find a different site that needs updating, and update 2-3 pages of the site using bootstrap.

Deploy your site on Netlify. You don't have to purchase domain name, just use the temporary domain name that was assigned when uploading your site.

When you submit your assignment, be sure to send me the link to your website.
